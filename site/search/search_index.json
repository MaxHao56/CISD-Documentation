The difference between muti-modal and muti-model is at the architecture layer. The former one describes the different types of files like speech, audio and video. The latter describes as the different types of databse management system that exists Without a Sinle System Scenario The muti-model database includes three different structure of data. Types of Data File Type Example Formal Definition Structured Relational Database Structured data follows schemas and table rules; often relational with well-defined connections. Semi-Structured JSON, XML, HTML Semi-structured data has patterns but lacks strict schemas and table structures. Unstructured Text, Video, Speech, Audio Unstructured data is typically plain and requires specialized techniques to extract information from various sources. the chanllange is that is complicated with query the data and modification of the data . With a Sinle System Scenario ArangoDB and OrientDB are both single databse storage and single DBMS with both are open source and free to use.
